  With the help of local fishing clubs, the WI DNR did a study of walleye
  movments on Lake Winnebago from 2011 to 2013. They inserted sonic tags into
  100 walleyes and set up devices to receive the signal emitted from these fish
  at various locations around the Lake Winnebago system. They produced a very
  informative report here
